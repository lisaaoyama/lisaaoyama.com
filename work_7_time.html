        <p><span class="bold">ISSUE:</span> I have never liked the saying ‘Time flies.’ I feel as though this annuls your memories, everything you have been through to reach this point, and is also somewhat disrespectful to the people that have been involved along the way. Only when you carefully look back on all the things that have happened will you realise how dense time really is.</p>
        <br><p><span class="bold">IDEA:</span> Time Doesn’t Fly is an installation to remind people of the density of our times. In retrospect, if we remember carefully, the times we have spent are packed with events and emotions, and I believe that if we could realise how dense our lives are, we would not perceive time to “fly”. By showing the photographs of myself in different stages of my life, the viewers are reminded of their own memories. In order to lessen the personal aspect of the photos, I erased my face out of each photo, and included mirror sheets in parts of the installation to reflect the viewer and trigger their own recollections.</p>

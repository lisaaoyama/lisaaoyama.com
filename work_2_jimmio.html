        <p><span class="bold">ISSUE:</span> Japanese people have great difficulty in speaking English, and consequently the English used in things like street signs and fashion goods are often quite odd. It is an unfortunate aspect of Japan that has been thought of as a fault: strange, incorrect uses of English, or Japanglish. They have long been the object of ridicule for foreigners; something that I have considered diminishes us Japanese to uneducated, unsophisticated people.</p>

        <p><span class="bold">IDEA:</span> Jimmio is a new term for strange uses of English in Japan. It is a concept to collect, study, and appreciate what was previously thought to be a fault of Japan. To promote the term, I compiled a booklet and a website.
        <br><br>If we canʼt get rid of Japanglish, can we interpret them from a different perspective? I wandered about central sightseeing spots, looking for strange English — something I hadnʼt previously done. Through studying the collected samples, I discovered that some of them were rather charming. Whether itʼs the mismatch of words, or the thought behind the language, somehow Japanglish seemed to unintentionally possess some captivating attributes.
        <br><br>In order to perceive one thing to be something different, I needed a different name to call it. Thus, I decided to name these charming Japanglish samples “Jimmio”, after a Japanese comedian known to make his audience laugh involuntarily.</p>

      <img class="work-image work-image-2 small thin" src="./images/2_jimmio_8.png" alt="">
      <div class="work-descr-detail-container">
        <p>For each Jimmio, I have written an “analysis”, in a satirical tone. However I have deliberately avoided using negative words, focusing on conveying the charming quality of the case. Also, I categorised them into the following groups, so as to clarify what about the Jimmio is so appealing.
        <br><br>- Idea Not Intentional: the Jimmio unintentionally gives an interesting idea/image
        <br>- OK but Mismatch: the Jimmio is grammatically alright, but it is used in an unexpected situation
        <br>- New Word: the Jimmio’s word/s are not found in the English dictionary
        <br>- Not Quite!: the mistake made is somehow memorable and charming
        <br><br> As the main medium to show Jimmio, I chose the web, due to its accessibility and the fact that readers could also participate in collecting Jimmios through submissions to the website. As a means to let people know of the existence of the website, I also compiled the analyses into a booklet, which will be issued irregularly and distributed at tourist centres.</p>

            <br><span class="bold">(Idea Not Intentional)</span>
            <br><br>This is really narratively interesting, because I think the character here has an extremely strong personality: she demands her love to be returned with an exclamation mark, having selfishly expressed her affection, and even though she is asking for someone’s opinion, by making them say “happy” or “good”, it seems she is merely asking them superficially.

          <p class="jimmio-eg-descr"><span class="bold italic">NO MENTI!</span>
            <br><span class="bold">(New Word)</span>
            <br><br>Found in Asakusa, near a stall that sells minced beef cutlet, they have signs all around the stall asking not to eat there. The signs sound pretty desperate, this one outdoing others in urgency, and consequently in humour as well. “Menti” refers to menchi-katsu, or minced beef cutlet (in Japanese, “ti” can represent the same pronunciation as “chi”). While it makes no sense at all, we can almost understand their sincere request, and the new catchy term “menti” is definitely a fruit of their effort.

            <br><span class="bold">(Not Quite!)</span>
            <br><br>As much as it looking rather chaotic due to the alphabetisation of “South East Exit” in Japanese, I would like to draw your attention to the latter half of this sign: “Sidewalk Under the Ground”. Perhaps they felt it more polite to emphasise it is under the ground (not underground); but anyway it gives that subtle touch of crustacean beat to a dull city sign, which has to be uplifting.

            <br><span class="bold">(OK but Mismatch)</span>
            <br><br>This unfortunate English copy, though grammatically correct, is significantly misleading. The Japanese sign above the counter reads: “Please do not take crepes or rubbish to the street or other buildings.” Though crepes may be “casual”, we must consume them with much care.

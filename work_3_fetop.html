        <p><span class="bold">ISSUE:</span> In many cases, African slum housing has corrugated iron or steel roofing. This is merely a compromise between cost, durability, and accessibility: an upgrade from thatched roofs in more rural areas, en route to tiled roofing of a formal settlement. However, the high insulation of the metal subjects the interior to extreme heat when there is sun; heavy showers would produce such an outrageous uproar that schools are forced into suspension, and crime rates increase due to the inability of victims to call for help. In addition, locals use the water collected from this roof, full of rust.</p>

        <p><span class="bold">IDEA:</span> Fetop - plastic roofing tiles. High in sound and thermal insulation, Fetop is made using a technology called RePlast, developed by ByFusion, which compresses plastic without the use of adhesives and washing solutions. By using plastic waste from the area, Fetop is made accessible for people living in slums. Its installation does not require special skills, with simple snap button attachments. A much preferable alternative to corrugated iron roofing, it can realise an improved living environment, including the collection of clean rainwater.</p>

        <p>How do we make it work? For people to actually take interest in these matters, it is essential for us to experience and know the situation. Hence, Fetop Cubicle: a chemical toilet which allows users to support the production of Fetop. Inside is an artificial rain machine and corrugated iron ceiling, and when a user enters - when they are in their most vulnerable state - the rain people experience in slums is reproduced. If the user empathises with the situation, they are given a choice to support the project through donation. The production of Fetop is conducted within slums, in a building with Fetop tiled roofs, where people can bring plastic waste in exchange for Fetop tiles and also experience its effectiveness.</p>

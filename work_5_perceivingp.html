        <p><span class="bold">IDEA:</span> Perceiving ¬P is a campaign to rethink the act of smoking from different perspectives. Embedded into the walls of the white space are symbolic objects representing ten stories about smoking told by ten people. In the centre is a piece of artwork that simulates the state of mind smokers experience during smoking.
          <br><br>The title and the logo expresses the concept of the project: understanding people with different perspectives to yours. "¬" is a sign of negation, and "P" stands for “proposition”, ”people”, and “perspectives”. In the context of smoking, there are two meanings to this title: for non-smokers, to think about smokers who do not conform to the trend to abolish smoking; and for smokers, to consider the viewpoints of non-smokers and other smokers.
          <br><br>Embedded into the walls are symbolic objects retelling the stories about smoking told by ten people (smokers and non-smokers). Viewers encounter the different sides to smoking through my narrative. Next to each object is a caption showing the interview notes and sketches I drew from those words that lead to the object, allowing viewers to follow my narrative process. I have focused on depicting the genuine emotions and images I conjured up from the stories, and avoided using motifs which may directly evoke smoking, such as tobacco and smoke. Also, I tried to vary the materials and method of expression used for each object according to the impression I got from the storyteller.
          <br><br>In the centre of the installation is a tank filled with some viscous liquid, producing bubbles that move very organically. Focusing on the unpredictable transformations of the bubbles, viewers seem to enter a trance, which is similar to what smokers experience during smoking. This tank aims to convey the mental effect of smoking, and also acts as an entrance object to the installation symbolising smoking.
          <br><br>In order to prevent any preconceptions of smoking hindering the viewers’ experiences of this installation, I have constructed this white tiled space to give a neutral impression.

        <p><span class="bold">BACKGROUND:</span> Having been interested in the idea of “Social Design”, I wanted to tackle a social issue for my graduation project. When I thought about what the immediate issue was personally, with my father and many friends being smokers, this was “smoking”.
          <br><br>Until high school, we were educated to understand smoking as “a threat to health”; however when I entered university and the number of friends who were smokers increased, my notion of smoking changed. Although I was never tempted to smoke myself, at least seeing various sides and values to smoking demolished my preconceptions of smoking. In hindsight, it felt odd that the public perception of smoking was so singular. If the majority were merely letting themselves follow the trend without giving this topic much thought, I hypothesised the possibility of a different solution through empathising with others. Furthermore, I wanted to address smokers who I felt sometimes smoked without motivation, just because the cigarette was there in front of them.
          <br><br>I decided to provide an opportunity to rethink the act of smoking for both sides.
          <br><br>I attempted to approach the topic using my ability “to express”, which is something I have nurtured over the four years I spent at this university. I got into contact with ten people of various ages, male and female, smokers and non-smokers, and asked them to talk about anything they wanted about smoking. I sincerely confronted these ten stories, utterly different in perspectives, and managed to complete ten objects using materials and expressions unique to each narrative. These objects are a result of my narrative superimposed onto each of the ten stories. I aim for these objects to act as a trigger for viewers to imagine each story and its storyteller in their own minds, and from multiple perspectives they may attempt to empathise with the diverse perceptions of smoking.
          <br><br>I would like to point out that it is vital we “attempt” to empathise. Non-smokers may never truly understand how it feels to smoke unless they smoke themselves. However we can imagine how it feels like by listening to the narratives of others.
          <br><br>In an interview with a smoker, he told me: “You should give it a try. You won’t ever know until you try.” Even if I had smoked then, I would not have felt the same way as him. If “empathy” were only possible by being in the exact same situation as the person in question, we may only ever be able to “attempt” to empathise. Nevertheless, under the belief that this can impact your views and your perceptions of the world, I tried to imagine the perspectives of smokers without smoking a single cigarette, and to create something that will persuade viewers to do the same.
          <br><br>Having encountered various perspectives, as a result, my fuzzy feeling of not being able to fully support or oppose to smoking has grown. However, if we suppose that the very notion of creating sides, whether to support or oppose, has lead to smoking becoming a social issue, perhaps this ambiguous feeling has a potential to become the foundation of a new solution.

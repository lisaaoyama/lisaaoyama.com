        <p><span class="bold">ISSUE:</span> When we communicate using words, we trust that what we mean is truly understood by the other. However in reality, words cannot illustrate precisely whatever we visualise. Images that words construct in our minds have their roots in our individual experiences, which differ for everyone, hence the words one sees or hears are interpreted in their very own way, making it an interpretation of what it originally meant to the person who uttered it.</p>
        <br><p><span class="bold">IDEA:</span> Bubbleway is a sculpture, showing an abstraction of conversations. The bubble represents the facts dealt in the conversation, and the curves show the participating speakers. The length of the curve is relative to the time spoken by a participant, and the curvature shows the depth of content in the speech. By guiding the bubble through the tube, the conversation is reproduced symbolically. When the bubble is clearly visible, the fact exists outside of minds; it has been released into the external world, but is not yet understood by anyone (in a real spoken conversation, this state will only last for a few milliseconds, while the sound waves travel from the mouth of one speaker to the ear of the other). When the bubble becomes obscured, it is interpreted within the speakers’ minds; it is no longer an objective fact, but a subjective interpretation.</p>

        <p>When the assignment was given, it was also announced that ultimately we would be given an opportunity to present our works at a local primary school. I decided to plan something that children could interact with.
        <br>Bubbleway can be played as a toy, the challenge being the fact that the bubble moves against gravity, contrary to its bead-like appearance.</p>

        <p>When I presented the works to the children, they immediately showed interest and began playing with them, trying to guide the bubble from one end to the other. The tubes were all the same length, which meant that they could compete against eacher, and this match style seemed to particularly excite them. I pointed out that the conversation written on the plate below corresponds to the curves of the tubes, and some children invented a game where one reads the conversation and the other must guide the bubble to the narration.
        <br><br>Afterwards when asked for feedback, to my surprise, the children answered that they could see how the tube was in correlation to the conversation, and empathise with real-life situations where communication was obscured, like the bubble, due to the difference in interpretations. Also, one child suggested that the difficulty of controlling the bubble and the fact that it moves in an unexpected direction implies the coincidental nature of communication, which turned out to be an insight into my own work.</p>
